## Keynote Speakers

We are pleased to annouce three international keynote speakers:

<p float="center">
  <img src="images/helena.jpeg" width="200" title="Helena Crowell"/>
</p>

**Helena Crowell**: Helena earned her undergraduate degree at the Univeristy of Heidelberg in 
Biochemistry. She then went on to earn her Master's degree in Computational Biology & Bioinformatics 
at the ETH Zurich. She is currently a PhD candidate in Statistical Bioinformatics at the University of
Zurich.

Helena focuses on developing analysis frameworks for CyTOF data and differential discovery in scRNA-seq data. She is the author of a popular Bioconductor package providing tools for preprocessing and analysis of cytometry data.

<p float="center">
  <img src="images/martin_morgan.jpg" width="200" title="Martin Morgan"/> 
</p>

**Martin Morgan**: Martin earned his undergraduate and Master's degrees in Botany at the University of Toronto. Martin's PhD studies at the University of Chicago involved the evolutionary consequences of frequency-dependent selection, and of multilocus deleterious mutation. Martin is currently at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo.

Martin leads the core team that maintains the Bioconductor project. He is the author of many Bioconductor packages and a renowned biostatistican.

<p float="center">
  <img src="images/elana.jpg" width="200" title="Elana Fertig"/>
</p>

**Elana Fertig**: Elana is an Associate Professor of Oncology at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to entering the field of computational cancer biology, Elana was a NASA research fellow in numerical weather prediction. 

Elana runs a hybrid computational and experimental lab in the systems biology of cancer and therapeutic response. Her computational methods blend mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence to determine the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of therapeutic resistance from multi-platform genomics data. 

## Invited Speakers

**Joshua Ho**, The University of Hong Kong

**John Marioni**, The University of Cambridge

**Shila Ghazanfar**, The University of Cambridge

## Presentations

The conference will feature selected talks (15mins), lightning talks (5mins), and software demos (5mins).
